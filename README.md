# Autonomous Racing RL: Zero-Shot Generalization in F1TENTH

This repository contains the training and evaluation pipeline for analyzing zero-shot generalization differences between on-policy (PPO) and off-policy (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithms under a time-optimal racing objective. 

The agent is trained on procedurally generated closed-loop circuits and evaluated zero-shot on real Formula One circuits (Silverstone, Monza, Spa, etc.).
